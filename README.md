# HeyKiara #
## What is? ##
Heykiara is my first public project uploaded to Github on 11 Jun 2020, even though the script was written a long time ago, this script shows an ASCII-ART animation of a little pig named Kiara waving goodbye.

## how it's done? ##
the program consists of 8 text files each containing an ASCII-ART animation frame as shown in the image below,
![exemple ASCII-ART](http://wloda.altervista.org/projects/heykiara.png)
finally there is a .sh file that prints each frame on the terminal creating the animation

## how does it work? ##
to download the program you can [click me to download the zip file](https://github.com/GitWloda/HeyKiara/archive/refs/heads/master.zip) or use the simple command `git clone https://github.com/GitWloda/HeyKiara` to download the repository without having to unzip anything once downloaded, just enter the folder and give all the necessary permissions to the .sh file by running the command `chmod + x ./AsciiAnimation`. to run the program just execute the command `./AsciiAnimation` inside the folder.
